# crud-app-backend

This is a backend application for a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) app. It is built using ![Node.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Node.js-339933?logo=node.js&logoColor=white), a powerful JavaScript runtime, and ![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Express-000000?logo=express&logoColor=white), a popular web application framework for Node.js. The app utilizes ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MongoDB-47A248?logo=mongodb&logoColor=white), a flexible NoSQL database, for data storage and retrieval.

The backend code handles incoming requests from the frontend, processes data, and interacts with the MongoDB database. It provides the necessary APIs and functionality to perform CRUD operations on the data.

By using Node.js and Express, the backend is able to handle concurrent requests efficiently and provide a scalable solution. MongoDB offers flexibility in data modeling and allows for easy integration with Node.js applications.

Overall, this backend application plays a crucial role in the functionality and performance of the CRUD app, enabling users to create, read, update, and delete data seamlessly.
